 * <p>Deletes the specified disk snapshot.</p>
 *          <p>When you make periodic snapshots of a disk, the snapshots are incremental, and only the
 *       blocks on the device that have changed since your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot.
 *       When you delete a snapshot, only the data not needed for any other snapshot is removed. So
 *       regardless of which prior snapshots have been deleted, all active snapshots will have access
 *       to all the information needed to restore the disk.</p>
 *          <p>The <code>delete disk snapshot</code> operation supports tag-based access control via
 *       resource tags applied to the resource identified by <code>disk snapshot name</code>. For more
 *       information, see the <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags">Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LightsailClient, DeleteDiskSnapshotCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lightsail"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LightsailClient, DeleteDiskSnapshotCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lightsail"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LightsailClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteDiskSnapshotRequest
 *   diskSnapshotName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteDiskSnapshotCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteDiskSnapshotCommandInput - {@link DeleteDiskSnapshotCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteDiskSnapshotCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteDiskSnapshotCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteDiskSnapshotCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LightsailClientResolvedConfig | config} for LightsailClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Lightsail throws this exception when the user cannot be authenticated or uses invalid
 *       credentials to access a resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link AccountSetupInProgressException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Lightsail throws this exception when an account is still in the setup in progress
 *       state.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidInputException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Lightsail throws this exception when user input does not conform to the validation rules
 *       of an input field.</p>
