 * <p>Deletes the known host key or certificate used by the Amazon Lightsail browser-based SSH or

 *          <important>
 *             <p>Perform this operation only if you were expecting the host key or certificate mismatch
 *         or if you are familiar with the new host key or certificate on the instance. For more
